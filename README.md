This is the repository for the course: Basic Unix for Engineers, which I took in the Spring of 
2016 during my sophomore year at Notre Dame.

This was my favorite course I have taken so far at Notre Dame. I learned how to navigate a Unix 
filesystem, edit and manipulate files, install Unix software, create shell scripts to automate
tasks, and write regular expressions to manipulate a dataset. Further, I explored system and 
network properties, developed python programs that use system calls to control processes and 
communicate through sockets.
