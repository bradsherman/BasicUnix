1. For this I would first create the file by using the command vim private.txt, and saving it. Then I would use chmod u+r,go-r to make sure only I (the user) can read it.
2. I would first use the command cd ~ to make sure I am in my home directory. Then I would use the command ln -s /afs/nd.edu/coursesp.16/cse/cse20189.01 unix where unix is the name of the link.
3. For this I would go to the directory that BigFile is located, and use ls -l ./BigFile. Then I would look at the 5th column which tells the size of the file.
4. For this I would use ls -l MyFolder and again look at the fifth column.
5. For this I would use the command kill -15 25263.
6. I would use the command killall -15 urxvt.
7. I would use the command time simulation.
8. I would use the command export VISUAL=vim and export EDITOR="$VISUAL".
