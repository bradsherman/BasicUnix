	Comments
	--------

	-For 6 & 7, you do not need the -15 option in your commands
	- For 8, this works, but only if you are using the bash/sh/ksh
	  shells, which is actually NOT how the ND shell is set up.
	  For csh, which the ND machines run, the only command that would
	  work is $setenv EDITOR vim. Good work!
